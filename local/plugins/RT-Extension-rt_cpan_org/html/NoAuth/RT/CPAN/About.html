    <h2 style="margin-top: 0">What is this all about?</h2>
    <p>
      This site tracks bugs in every distribution released through
      <a href="http://cpan.org">CPAN</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      See the <a href="Usage.html">quick usage guidelines</a> if you want to know how to use this site.  These guidelines are also on the login page.
    </p>

    <h2>Recommendations (soft rules)</h2>
    <h3>For reporters</h3>

    <h4>Be polite</h4>

    <h4>Are maintainers required to act on all bugs reported by end users?</h4>
    <p>No. They are not. Unless you have an outside contractual relationship with
    a maintainer, you need to assume that they are a volunteer. Telling them they
    "must" do something is impolite and counterproductive.</p>
    
    <h4>Should maintainers accept bug reports against older versions of a module?</h4>
    <p>In general, we discourage bug reports against older versions of modules other
    than for historical reporting purposes (i.e. resolved immediately upon report with a
    note that it's been tested and found to work in the current version.)</p>
    <p>If a bug exists in the current CPAN version of a module, please do report the bug.</p>
    
    <h3>For authors and maintainers</h3>

    <h4>Be polite</h4>

    <h4>Can a module have its own bug tracker?</h4>
    <p>Sure it can, but that does not disable the module's RT queue and users can still
    create tickets on rt.cpan.org.</p>

    <h2>What is used to power this service?</h2>
    <p>All parts used to build this service are open source software.
    The core is <a href="http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/">Request Tracker</a>
    from Best Practical Solutions. Everything else is either an extension for this
    site or a module from the CPAN.</p>

    <p>rt.cpan.org has some customizations which tie it to a particular RT version; at this
    moment (March 2013) it's RT 4.0.</p>

    <p>You can explore the source code by checking out the repository:<br />
    <pre>    git clone git://github.com/bestpractical/rt-extension-rt_cpan_org.git</pre><br />
    or by going to its web page, at
    <a href="http://github.com/bestpractical/rt-extension-rt_cpan_org">RT-Extension-rt_cpan_org</a>.
    There is <a href="http://github.com/bestpractical/rt-extension-rt_cpan_org/blob/master/bin/pull-live">a script in the bin directory</a>
    of the extension that installs everything.</p>
